# Controlling Computer using hand gestures

The is an attempt to control keyboard and mouse inputs using hand gestures detected using openCV and processed by mediapipe by drawing landmarks using mediapipe and implementing them using pyautogui.

There are 3 files here - 

volume_control.py - to control computer volumne using index finger

dino.py - to play dino game using hand gesture.

rpg_game_control.py - to play an rpg game using both gestures from both hands. 


The file HandTrackingModule.py is created to encompass all and methods.

## Features
- **Gesture Recognition:** Detects hand gestures using a webcam.
- **Customizable Gestures:** Modify gestures to fit specific needs.
- **Application Control:** Integrate with applications for hands-free interaction.

   ```

3. **Install the required dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. Ensure your webcam is connected.
2. Run the gesture control script:
